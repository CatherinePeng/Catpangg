--Subqueries versus Join!
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_id IN (SELECT cust_id 
				  FROM Orders
				  WHERE order_num IN (SELECT order_num
									  FROM OrderItems
									  WHERE prod_id= 'RGAN01'));
-- BUT u can also write it dis way
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact
FROM Customers AS C, Orders AS O, OrderItems AS OI
WHERE C.cust_id = O.cust_id
AND OI.order_num = O.order_num
AND prod_id= 'RGAN01';

--SELF JOIN (wtf though?)
