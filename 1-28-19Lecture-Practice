-- This is Catherine Peng's practice on her own
-- The "%" sign Wildcard: DBSM finds anything after the word "Fish"
SELECT prod_id, prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE 'Fish%';

-- The "%" sign wild card here match any value that contain the text "bean bag" anywhere within it
SELECT prod_id, prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE '%bean bag%';

-- The "%" sign wild card here represents 0, 1, or more characters at the sepcified location in the search pattern
SELECT prod_id, prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE 'F%y';

-- Searching for partial email address; when you forget an email address or something.
SELECT cust_name, cust_email
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_email LIKE 's%@villagetoys.com';
